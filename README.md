Sample files for getting up and running with the YourMapper API.

Mashape
-------

To consume our API through Mashape, do the following:

1. Go to https://www.mashape.com/yourmapper browse our Mashape APIs
2. Sign up for a Mashape account.
3. Subscribe to one of the APIs (eg, YourMapper2: https://www.mashape.com/yourmapper/yourmapper2#!pricing )
4. Create a unique production key for the API you'd like to use: https://www.mashape.com/keys

Now you can use the code samples that Mashape provides at the top of each API endpoint (Curl Java Node PHP Python Objective-C Ruby .NET).

Optionally, you can use the MashapeExample.php file we've created in this repo on your server.
