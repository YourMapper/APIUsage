1. Go to https://www.mashape.com/yourmapper browse our Mashape APIs
2. Sign up for a Mashape account.
3. Subscribe to one of the APIs (eg, YourMapper2: https://www.mashape.com/yourmapper/yourmapper2#!pricing )
4. Create a unique applcation using the Mashape topnav, then click Get the Keys at the top right of that applicaiton

Now you can use the code samples that Mashape provides at the top of each API endpoint (Curl Java Node PHP Python Objective-C Ruby .NET).

Optionally, you can use the MashapeExample.php file we've created in this repo on your server, if Mashape's dynamic code samples don't cut it for you.
